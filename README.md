NORTH FARMERS INDICATORS

1- Data Collection

This step involves the following:

1.1- Definition of Objectives: Based on the project indicators, such as the number of beneficiaries disaggregated by gender, new or ancient farmers, target crops, and type of benefits disaggregated by gender and commune. Also, total area disaggregated by gender, commune, and target crops.

1.2- Data Source: Population of farmers within the study area.

1.3- Data Collection Method: Stratified sampling - the population of farmers within the study area is divided into strata based on discriminant variables such as crops, localities, and gender. Then, a random sample is taken from each stratum.

1.4- Data Collection Tools (Instruments): (Instrument types: Paper, electronic)

1.5 - Pilot Testing

1.6- Data Collection

2- Data Processing

This step involves cross-checking, wrangling, validation, and data engineering.

3- Exploratory Data Analysis

In this step, we compute indicators, create statistical tables, charts, maps, and conduct hypothesis testing.

4- Indicators Dashboard

The data will be visualized using tools such as Power BI, Streamlit, or R Shiny.

Overall, the revised text is clearer and more concise. It emphasizes the steps involved in the data collection process and the tools used for data analysis and visualization.
